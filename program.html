        <h3>The Chair Project: Generative models as Automatism</h3>
        <p>The Surrealist artists of the 20th century used a range of generative art making techniques called
            automatisms to stimulate their imagination. In this talk I will present a case study for using generative
            models as automatisms to co-design a series of objects with AI. Then, remembering a time when 128x128px GAN
            images seemed crisp, I will try to contextualize the frenzy of recent innovations in generative models.</p>
